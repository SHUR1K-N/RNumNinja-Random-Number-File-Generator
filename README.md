# R.NumNinja: The Random Number File Generator

A fast random number file generator (500,000+ lines per second) I created, that will take a [custom range of integers] and the [number of lines to be generated] as the input and then generate a text document of randomized integers within the specified constraints; also supports redundancy-elimating mode (non-repeating values). Ideal to aid in benchmarking sorting algorithms. This project was created in Python, primarily for the purpose of testing my own [Double-Edged Sorting algorithm's](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/Double-Edged-Sort) performance.

**Dependencies to "pip install" before being able to run the Python files:**

**tqdm** (for progress bars)

**colorama** (for colors)

**termcolor** (for colors)
