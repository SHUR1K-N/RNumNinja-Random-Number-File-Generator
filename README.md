# RandomNinja: Random Number File Generator

## Description & Usage
A fast random number file generator (up to 500,000+ lines per second), that generates a file with randomized integers within the user-specified constraints such as minimum value, maximum value, number of integers to be generated between them, whether redundancy is allowed or not, etc.; ideal to aid in benchmarking sorting algorithms or any general usage scenario where large sets of random integers may be required (such as statistics).

This project was created in Python, primarily for the purpose of testing my own [**Double-Edged Sorting algorithm's**](https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/Double-Edged-Sort) performance.

### Zero-Redundancy Mode
When the user selects the option to not allow repeating values, RandomNinja generates uniquely random integers.
